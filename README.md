for the argocd policies 


To define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules in Argo CD, you can add new policies to the argocd-rbac-cm (ConfigMap) file. The argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap contains the RBAC configuration for Argo CD.

To add new policies, follow these steps:

Locate and edit the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap file. This file is typically stored in the argocd namespace.

Copy code
kubectl edit configmap argocd-rbac-cm -n argocd
In the ConfigMap, you'll find a YAML configuration that defines the RBAC rules. It should resemble the following structure:

kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, admin, applications, *, *, *, *, *
    p, role:readonly, applications, get, *, *, *, *
    ...
To add new policies, modify the policy.csv section of the ConfigMap. Each policy is defined as a line in the policy.csv field. The structure of a policy line is as follows:

p, <subject>, <resource>, <action>, <object>, <target>, <effect>, <condition>

p, <subject>, <resource>, <action>, <object>, <target>, <effect>, <condition>
<subject>: Represents the subject or role. It can be a user, group, or role.
<resource>: Specifies the resource type (e.g., applications, repositories).
<action>: Defines the action or permission on the resource (e.g., get, create, update, delete).
<object>: Specifies the object within the resource (e.g., my-app, * for all objects).
<target>: Represents the target or destination for the action (e.g., * for all targets).
<effect>: Specifies the effect or result of the policy (e.g., allow, deny).
<condition>: Optionally defines conditions that must be satisfied for the policy to apply.
Note: The RBAC policy syntax may vary depending on the version of Argo CD you are using. The above example is based on a common syntax.
  

Add your desired policies as new lines in the policy.csv section. Here's an example of adding a new policy:
  

  
 kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, admin, applications, *, *, *, *, *
    p, role:readonly, applications, get, *, *, *, *
    p, role:developer, applications, update, my-app, *, *, *
    ...
  

  
In the example above, a new policy role:developer is added, granting the update permission on the my-app application to the role:developer role.

Save the changes to the ConfigMap and exit the editor.

The changes will take effect automatically, and Argo CD will apply the updated RBAC rules based on the modified argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap.

Please note that the RBAC configuration and syntax may vary depending on the specific version of Argo CD you are using. Make sure to refer to the official documentation or the version-specific configuration guide for accurate details.
  

  
  
  
 Certainly! Here are some common actions or permissions that can be used in RBAC policies:

get: Allows reading or retrieving information about a resource.
  
list: Enables listing or viewing a collection of resources.
  
create: Grants permission to create or add new resources.
  
update: Allows modifying or updating existing resources.
  
delete: Enables deleting or removing resources.
  
sync: Allows syncing or deploying applications.
  
override: Grants permission to override resource settings or configurations.
  
approve: Allows approving or accepting changes.
  
reject: Enables rejecting or declining changes.
  
rollback: Grants permission to roll back changes to a previous state.
  
annotate: Allows adding annotations to resources.
  
manage: Grants permission to manage or perform administrative tasks.
  
execute: Enables executing or running commands or scripts.
  
read: Allows read-only access to resources.
  
write: Enables write access to resources.
  
execute-tasks: Grants permission to execute tasks or workflows.
  
  
  
  
Please note that the available actions may vary depending on the specific resource type and the implementation of RBAC in the target system. The above list represents common actions used in RBAC systems and can be customized based on your specific requirements.
  
  
  
applications: Represents applications or deployments.
repositories: Refers to source code repositories or version control systems.
clusters: Represents Kubernetes clusters or other infrastructure clusters.
namespaces: Refers to Kubernetes namespaces.
secrets: Represents secrets or sensitive information.
configmaps: Refers to Kubernetes ConfigMaps or configuration data.
services: Represents Kubernetes services or network services.
pods: Refers to Kubernetes pods or running containers.
deployments: Represents deployments or replicaset resources.
jobs: Refers to Kubernetes jobs or batch processes.
cronjobs: Represents Kubernetes cron jobs or scheduled tasks.
ingresses: Refers to Kubernetes ingresses or network routing rules.
servicesaccounts: Represents Kubernetes service accounts.
roles: Refers to RBAC roles or permissions.
rolebindings: Represents RBAC role bindings or associations.
clusterroles: Refers to cluster-wide RBAC roles or permissions.
clusterrolebindings: Represents cluster-wide RBAC role bindings or associations.
persistentvolumes: Refers to persistent volumes or storage resources.
persistentvolumeclaims: Represents persistent volume claims or storage requests.
statefulsets: Refers to Kubernetes stateful sets or stateful applications.
Please note that the available resource types may vary depending on the specific system or framework you are using for RBAC. The above list represents common resource types used in RBAC systems and can be customized based on your specific environment or application.

what about for logs
ChatGPT
For logs, RBAC policies typically do not directly control access to individual log entries. Instead, RBAC is primarily used to control access to the resources or systems that generate and store logs. The specific resource types related to logs may vary depending on the logging solution or infrastructure in use. Here are some common resource types that may be relevant when managing access to logs:

log sources: Represents the sources or systems generating the logs, such as applications, containers, or servers.
log collectors: Refers to the components responsible for collecting logs from various sources and centralizing them.
log aggregators: Represents the systems or services that aggregate logs from multiple sources and provide centralized access to them.
logging systems: Refers to the overall logging infrastructure, which may include components like log storage, indexing, and searching.
log databases: Represents the storage systems or databases where logs are stored.
log indexes: Refers to indexes or searchable metadata associated with log entries.
log search: Represents the capability to search and retrieve log entries based on specific criteria.
log analysis: Refers to systems or tools used to analyze and gain insights from log data.
It's important to note that RBAC may not directly control access at the level of individual log entries, but rather at a higher level to the resources involved in generating, storing, and analyzing logs. The specific resource types and access control mechanisms for logs may depend on the logging solution or platform being used in your environment.
