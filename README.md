for the argocd policies 


To define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules in Argo CD, you can add new policies to the argocd-rbac-cm (ConfigMap) file. The argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap contains the RBAC configuration for Argo CD.

To add new policies, follow these steps:

Locate and edit the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap file. This file is typically stored in the argocd namespace.

Copy code
kubectl edit configmap argocd-rbac-cm -n argocd
In the ConfigMap, you'll find a YAML configuration that defines the RBAC rules. It should resemble the following structure:

kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, admin, applications, *, *, *, *, *
    p, role:readonly, applications, get, *, *, *, *
    ...
To add new policies, modify the policy.csv section of the ConfigMap. Each policy is defined as a line in the policy.csv field. The structure of a policy line is as follows:

p, <subject>, <resource>, <action>, <object>, <target>, <effect>, <condition>

Copy code
p, <subject>, <resource>, <action>, <object>, <target>, <effect>, <condition>
<subject>: Represents the subject or role. It can be a user, group, or role.
<resource>: Specifies the resource type (e.g., applications, repositories).
<action>: Defines the action or permission on the resource (e.g., get, create, update, delete).
<object>: Specifies the object within the resource (e.g., my-app, * for all objects).
<target>: Represents the target or destination for the action (e.g., * for all targets).
<effect>: Specifies the effect or result of the policy (e.g., allow, deny).
<condition>: Optionally defines conditions that must be satisfied for the policy to apply.
Note: The RBAC policy syntax may vary depending on the version of Argo CD you are using. The above example is based on a common syntax.
  
  
Add your desired policies as new lines in the policy.csv section. Here's an example of adding a new policy:
  
 kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: argocd-rbac-cm
  namespace: argocd
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, admin, applications, *, *, *, *, *
    p, role:readonly, applications, get, *, *, *, *
    p, role:developer, applications, update, my-app, *, *, *
    ...
  
  
In the example above, a new policy role:developer is added, granting the update permission on the my-app application to the role:developer role.

Save the changes to the ConfigMap and exit the editor.

The changes will take effect automatically, and Argo CD will apply the updated RBAC rules based on the modified argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap.

Please note that the RBAC configuration and syntax may vary depending on the specific version of Argo CD you are using. Make sure to refer to the official documentation or the version-specific configuration guide for accurate details.

override: Grants permission to override resource settings or configurations.
approve: Allows approving or accepting changes.
reject: Enables rejecting or declining changes.
rollback: Grants permission to roll back changes to a previous state.
annotate: Allows adding annotations to resources.
manage: Grants permission to manage or perform administrative tasks.
